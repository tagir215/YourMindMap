There's old and new code mixed. For example the MainActivity class was written before I even knew what OOP meant. 
If you are a recruiter please let me know if I should improve the code of these projects or maybe focus on making new projects (or some other thing of millions of things). I'm not 100% sure where to spend my time. tagir.tsarkov@gmail.com
